# Materials for Day 1: Bayesian Basics


This folder contains the lecture slides (not annotated, they will be annotated live during the workshop), and some files for in-class exercises. 

The exercises are available as python jupyter notebooks or as R markdown files. You may use either the notebooks with python or the markdown files within R Studio. **You should use the files ending in "_template" in class, and try the exercise on your own before looking at the solutions**. The solutions can be found in the html files. 

Gwen will be using the R markdown files to go over the solutions and discuss the plots, etc.
