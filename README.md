### Python Packages and Environment

### R Statistical Software and packages

**Step 1:** Follow the instructions [here](https://ftp.cixug.es/CRAN/) to download the *R Statistical Software* for your operating system

**Step 1a (if you're on Windows):** Install Rtools [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools45/rtools.html)

**Step 2 (if you want to learn how to use R):** Follow the instructions [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) to download R Studio 

**Step 3:** Open up R (either in a console or in R Studio), and install the following packages using the command `install.packages("nameofpackage")`:

- `brms`
- `visreg`
- `ggplot2`
- `tidyverse`
- `tidybayes`

  For example, running `install.packages("brms")` will install the brms package.

**Step 4:** To _use_ the package in R (or R Studio), run the command e.g., `library(brms)`. You need to run the `library` function for a package each time you open up R. But once you have loaded it within a session, you do not need to load it again.
